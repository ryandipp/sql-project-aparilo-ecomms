these scripts help stakeholders grasping insights to answer questions such as:

1. What is the average order value and purchase frequency for customers who made a purchase in the past 6 months,
and how do these metrics compare to customers who made a purchase more than 6 months ago?

2. What are the top-selling products by category and brand,
and what is the average sale price for these products?

3. How does the distribution of male and female customers differ across different product categories,
and are there any categories that are predominantly purchased by one gender?

4. What is the average time it takes to process an order from the date it is placed to the date it is delivered, and
are there any trends or patterns in the order statuses that can be identified to improve this process?

5. What is the customer retention rate over time for each acquisition source,
and are there any sources that are performing better or worse than others?
How can we leverage this information to improve customer retention and drive repeat business from these sources?
